# C# Interview Preparation Exercises

A comprehensive collection of C# exercises and demonstrations covering topics from core concepts to advanced system design and high-performance programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections, each focusing on a specific area of C# and software engineering:

1.  **Core C# Concepts (`A_CoreConcepts.cs`)**: LINQ, Collections, Base64 encoding, String manipulation, and Basic algorithms.
2.  **Problem Solving (`B_ProblemSolving.cs`)**: Anagrams, Duplicate detection, Array rotation, and Two-pointer techniques.
3.  **Advanced Topics (`C_AdvancedTopics.cs`)**: Concurrency (Thread safety, Race conditions), Asynchronous programming, and Design Patterns (Decorator).
4.  **Object-Oriented Programming (`D_ObjectOrientedProgramming.cs`)**: Strategy Pattern, Singleton, Adapter, Observer (Events/Delegates), and Structs vs. Classes.
5.  **System Design Problems (`E_SystemDesignProblems.cs`)**: Leaderboard systems, HttpClient best practices, IQueryable optimization, and Thread-safe counters.
6.  **High Performance (`F_HighPerformance.cs`)**: Memory optimization using `Span<T>`, `stackalloc`, and high-performance `structs`.
7.  **Controller Refactoring Challenge (`G_ControllerChallenge.cs`)**: Refactoring "Fat Controllers" using Dependency Injection and Clean Architecture principles.
8.  **Middleware Pipeline Simulation (`H_Middleware.cs`)**: Understanding the ASP.NET Core Middleware pipeline with Error Handling and Performance Logging simulations.
9.  **Critical C# Concepts (`I_CriticalConcepts.cs`)**: `yield return` (Lazy Evaluation), Reflection, Custom Attributes, and the `IDisposable` pattern.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

## How to Run

To execute all exercises and see the results in the console:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Technologies Used

- .NET 9.0
- Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (for caching demonstrations)
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (for DI demonstrations)
- Microsoft.Extensions.Http (for IHttpClientFactory demonstrations)
